    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold">About me</h1>
    <p>My name is Barnabas Olayinka Inyangsam, and I'm a product designer who focuses on creating beautiful experiences for people that improve and enhance how we live. Currently resides in the city of Lagos, Nigeria. I enjoy assisting others, understanding their needs and behaviors, and bringing their ideas to reality.</p>
    <p>Good design, in my opinion, should be usable, straightforward, and appealing, and should be the outcome of a thorough understanding of the target user. I enjoy learning new things while perfecting and growing my trade and challenging myself to improve.</p>
    <p>I work as a UI/UX designer for Zuri Chat, where I collaborate with technical teams to create Zuri Chat App, a messaging service that will compete with Slack and Discord in the coming years. I enjoy getting my hands dirty from concept to completion, whether it's interacting with customers/stakeholders, creating beautiful visual design & case studies, animating prototypes for engineers, or listening to mentors to accomplish excellent results.</p>
    <p>When I'm not pushing pixels, I'm managing Sam Bain (a clothing brand that designs and manufactures Nigerian native attire for men), assisting fashion designers with creative communication, reading, and rooting for Manchester United and the Miami Heat.</p>
